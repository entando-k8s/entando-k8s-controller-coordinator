        These vulnerabilities are K8S server side vulnerabilities related to specific versions of K8S. Somehow
        this version of Quarkus has been linked to certain versions of K8S. The client only needs to upgrade to
        later versions of the K8S to avoid these vulnerabilities

        Not much we can do about this one except for wait for Keycloak 8. We can only update the client if the
        server is updated.
